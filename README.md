# Hello Nik! (h1 tag in markdown)

## Welcome to my HUMIS homepage repository (h2 tag in markdown)

> This repository is for my professor for my GDES 2342 spring 2025 class, for the HUMIS homepage assignment.
> I learned more on how to use html and css to create a web page, like how to separate my web page into different
> sections like headers and footers. Among other things, I learned how to use nav elements and learned many different
> ways I can format a web page.
> Through the skills I have learned with this assignment, I will be able to more easily create web pages that can be
> used in both creative and professional settings, for both myself and future careers.
